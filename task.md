## Tasks
### 1. Model Summary
   1. Illustrate the changes of the predictions the model makes on the training data through each epoch
   2. Identify `interesting` epoch where the model starts to learn the data or the model has unusual behaviors
   
### 2. Model Comparison
   1. Provide a visual summary of user-selected instances by visualizing the predictions made by different models
   2. Identify `interesting` instances on which the models disagree with each other
   
### 3. Model Diagnosis 
   1. Provide a visual interpretation of training process of the model
   2. Visualize the gradients change of each hidden layer and the original input
   2. Aggregate the impacts of mutiple instances on the training process
